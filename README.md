# causal-inference

Welcome to our research project on the use of causal inference in analysing and modelling business problems. This project aims to explore the effectiveness of causal inference techniques in providing insights into various business problems and how it can help decision-makers make informed decisions.

Causal inference is a statistical approach that seeks to determine the causal relationship between variables. It is an essential tool for researchers who want to understand the underlying mechanisms that drive the outcomes of interest. In the context of business, causal inference can help in identifying the factors that influence business performance, predicting the impact of potential interventions, and evaluating the effectiveness of policies and strategies.

In this project, we will be using various causal inference methods, including causal discovery, causal effect estimation and quantifying interventions to analyze and model and visualize different business problems. We will explore how these techniques can be applied to real-world data sets, and how they can assist business decision-makers.

Our research project is hosted on Github, and we welcome contributions from anyone interested in this topic. We hope that this project will not only advance our understanding of causal inference in business but also provide a useful resource for anyone looking to apply these techniques to their own research projects.
